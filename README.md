# Deims - D6

This is the original DEIMS effort based on Drupal-6.  You are probably looking for the new [DEIMS] (http://github.com/lter/deims), which is based on Drupal 7.

This repo was hosted in Google-code, we moved it here since Google is conceding (so to speak).  

If you do find a need to use this repo, plese use the Wiki pages and informational resources to do so.  At this point, this repo
is no longer maintained, only security fixes and the likes.

The branch called bdp-metavist contains content types that contemplate almost all the possible fields and descriptors that can be identified using the Biological Data Profile (by the FGDC) and mimics a bit the work of the Desktop tool Metavist. the content types include the GIS-oriented content, projections, datums and all related parameters and attributes.
